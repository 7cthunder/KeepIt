## What's it?
It is just a clock in app built by blockchain.

## How to run it?

Frist, you should run a **private Ethereum chain** on local. If you don't know how to do that, [this way](https://7cthunder.github.io/2018/11/04/%E5%8C%BA%E5%9D%97%E9%93%BE%20%7C%20%E5%88%9D%E6%8E%A2%E4%BB%A5%E5%A4%AA%E5%9D%8A/).

Second, go to the directory `./vue-client`, and following instructions can help you.
``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```
